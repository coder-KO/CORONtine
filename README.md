# CORONtine

## Description
CORONtine automates the process of seggregating possible Corona Virus (COVID19) suspects by scanning them for common COVID19 symptoms without direct human involvement.

In tough times like this when the whole country is in lockdown state, there are many security personnels, junior resident doctors, police men are doing the job of quarantining probable corona virus suspects to save our country from this pandemic. But providing  proper protective gears for such large number of people is difficult which leaves them with simple masks while scanning thousands of people daily, out of which some might be suffering from this horrible disease. This lack in complete protective gear make even them vulnerable to COVID19. CORONtine aims to solve this problem by scanning people for common traits for COVID19 and let authorised people quarnatine them without direct human involvement. This way probable victims of COVID19 can be seggregated for making it easier for even the main senior doctors teams to identify patients of COVID19.
